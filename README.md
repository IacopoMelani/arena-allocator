# Arena Allocator
This is a proof of concept implementation of an arena allocator in C during my boring nights.

## Credits
- **Dylan Falconer**'s [article](https://bytesbeneath.com/articles/the-arena-custom-memory-allocators) on custom memory allocators was a great help in understanding the concept of arena allocators.

- **domnikl**'s [implementation](https://gist.github.com/domnikl/af00cc154e3da1c5d965) of simple dump memory viewer.
